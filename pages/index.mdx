# Max Walts

I'm a senior at the University of Michigan studying Business with a CS minor.

I learned to code using C++, but I spend most of my time building full-stack apps using Next.js for web, React Native for mobile, and Python for running scripts and servers. Over the last 4 years, I've had the chance to lead engineering teams, design cross-platform apps, and build many automated data analysis pipelines.

I'm now looking for full-time opportunities at a bigger company. I'm also open to freelance work.
