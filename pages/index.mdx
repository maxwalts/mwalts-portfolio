# Max Walts

Hey there! I'm a dual-degree senior at the University of Michigan studying CS and Business. I'm passionate about solving complex problems in startup environments with the best teams.

I learned to code using C++, but I spend most of my time building full-stack apps using Next.js for web, React Native for mobile, and Python for running scripts and servers. Over the last 4 years, I've had the chance to lead engineering teams, design cross-platform apps, and automate trading strategies that were put to live trading.

I'm now looking for full-time opportunities in software engineering and product management. I'm also open to freelance work.
